  # Update Wire Payments to Reference Contracts

  1. Table Updates
    - Add `contract_id` to `wire_payments` table
    - Link payments to contracts instead of only subcontractors
    - Keep subcontractor_id for backward compatibility and easier querying
    - Add constraint to ensure contract_id is provided for all new payments

  2. Security
    - RLS policies remain the same as they already cover the new field

  3. Indexes
    - Add index on contract_id for faster lookups and joins

  4. Notes
    - Existing payments will have NULL contract_id initially
    - A separate data migration script can populate contract_id for existing payments
    - New payments must include a contract_id
