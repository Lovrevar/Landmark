# Module: Supervision

**Path:** `src/components/Supervision/`

## Overview

Construction site supervision: manages active build sites, subcontractor contracts, phase/milestone tracking, work logs, invoices, and payments for on-site work.

---

## Sub-modules

### SiteManagement
**Path:** `Supervision/SiteManagement/`

The core supervision module. Full project site view with phases, subcontractor contracts, milestone tracking, document management, and financial summaries per phase.

#### Services

> The original monolithic `siteService.ts` was split by entity during the May 2026 audit refactor. `siteService.ts` is now a thin barrel that keeps a couple of project-level fetchers and re-exports the per-entity service files below, so existing `import * as siteService` consumers keep working unchanged. New code should import directly from the entity-specific file.

### services/siteService.ts (barrel)
- `fetchAllProjects()` — fetches all site projects ordered by start date
- `fetchSubcontractorsWithPhases()` — fetches active/draft contracts joined with subcontractor, phase, and contract-type details; returns a flat list keyed by contract
- Re-exports everything from phaseService, siteContractService, siteSubcontractorService, milestoneService, siteFundingService, and wirePaymentService
- **Depends on:** supabase client; the six entity service files below

### services/phaseService.ts
- `fetchProjectPhases()` — fetches all phases ordered by project then phase number
- `recalculatePhaseBudget(phaseId)` — recomputes budget_used for a phase from active/draft contract amounts
- `recalculateAllPhaseBudgets()` — recomputes budget_used for every phase across all projects

## Notes
- `SiteManagement/` and `Retail/Projects/` share a similar phase/milestone UI pattern — keep in sync when updating either
- Subcontractor/contract documents are no longer stored via a SiteManagement-owned bucket. `uploadSubcontractorDocuments` (siteSubcontractorService) delegates to the central Documents `documentService.uploadDocument` under the `IZVODACI` category, attaching associations to the subcontractor, contract, project, and phase. `ContractDocumentViewer` reads/deletes via `documentService` (fetchDocumentsByEntity, getDocumentSignedUrl, deleteDocument). The old `ContractDocument` type was removed from SiteManagement/types.ts
- `ContractDocumentViewer` accepts `subcontractorId` (required) and optional `contractId` to filter by contract
- VAT_RATE_OPTIONS = [0, 5, 13, 25] — defined in SiteManagement/types.ts
- The original monolithic `siteService.ts` was split into per-entity service files (phase, contract, subcontractor, milestone, funding, wire payment) during the May 2026 audit refactor; `siteService.ts` now re-exports them so `import * as siteService` consumers keep working
- Payment create/update/delete from SiteManagement now only warn the user — those operations moved to the Accounting module (Invoices/Payments)
- All delete confirmation dialogs use `ConfirmDialog` from `src/components/ui/` via the pending-item hook pattern; `useProjectPhases` uses a Promise-based `requestConfirm` pattern for mid-flow budget-mismatch confirmations — never use `window.confirm()` or `confirm()`
